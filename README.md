# FinalProject
Check in 1 Questions:
1: My main gameplay loop is not yet implemented, but will feature platforming and progressable levels
2: I am using tilemaps and layers to create my environment, there will be a background and foreground in the finished project
3: Player is controlled via keyboard, specifically WASD. A custom script is used to control player velocity and gravity, along with how many jumps the player has. Tilemaps are given ground or floor layer functionality for correct interactivity with wallsliding and walking.
